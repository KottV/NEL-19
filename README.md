# NEL-19 - VST3 - 64bit - Windows only
An open-source high-fidelity random vibrato.


NEL-19 requires the latest C++ dependencies. you can dl and install them here until i make a proper installer that takes care of that:
https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

NEL-19 has:

- Depth-Parameter. Use it to adjust the depth of the vibrato relative to its current buffer size.
- Frequency-Parameter. Use it to adjust the frequency of the randomized LFO.
- Width-Parameter. It mixes in a unique LFO for every other channel.
- STUDIO-Button. Enables Lookahead.
- Buffersize-Textfield. Buffersizes between 1-7ms are rather subtle and have low latency. Everything else is for creative use up to 1000ms.
- MIDI Learn-Button. Use either pitchbend- or midi CC to control the vibrato manually in addition to the randomizer.

Here are a bunch of videos, where you can check out the plugin in action and topics around it:
